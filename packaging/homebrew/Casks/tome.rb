# The cask, and the source of truth for it.

# This file is mirrored to `alexnodeland/homebrew-tap` by the release workflow
# on tag, at the same path. Edit it HERE — an edit made in the tap is
# overwritten by the next release, silently, which is the worst kind of lost
# change.
#
# Tome ships UNSIGNED and un-notarized (ADR-0006: the Apple Developer Program
# is deferred). Gatekeeper therefore blocks first launch, and the caveats carry
# the fix. Revisit at v1.0.
#
# `version` and `sha256` below are rewritten by the release workflow from the
# tag and the DMG it just built. They are NOT `:latest` / `:no_check`: Tome is
# unsigned, so the checksum is the only integrity check a user gets, and
# turning it off would remove the last one. The two lines are matched by a
# fixed pattern in .github/workflows/release.yml, and `scripts/verify-bundle.sh`
# asserts that pattern still matches — so reformatting this file cannot
# silently break the release.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Tome is not signed by Apple, so macOS will refuse the first launch.
    To allow it:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Tome.app

    (macOS 15 removed the Control-click then Open bypass, so the command
    above is the way, not a shortcut for it.)

    The `tome` command line tool is installed alongside the app and shares
    its library:

      tome add https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/
      tome pull rust-std
      tome search "hash map"

    Your library lives in ~/Library/Application Support/Tome and cached
    documentation in ~/Library/Caches/Tome.

    `brew uninstall --zap tome` removes both. It cannot remove the API
    token, which is in the Keychain — run this first if you ever started
    the HTTP API:

      tome config forget-token
  EOS
end
